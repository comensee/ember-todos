ember-todos
===========

Yet another fork of the *wildly* popular Todos application.

What I set out to do:
* Use ember with AMD/require, borrowing heavily from existing Todo apps
* Use yeoman to manage the configuration

To use:
* Install yeoman
* Run/build
    > yeoman server
    > yeoman build & yeoman server:dist
